What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-). Each character of the alphabet and digits are represented by a unique combination of short and long signals.

Historical Background

Morse code was developed in the early 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. It was created to allow for long-distance communication via telegraph systems. Its efficiency and simplicity made it a crucial tool in early telecommunication and wartime communication.

How Morse Code Works

Each letter or number is represented by a specific pattern of dots and dashes. For example:
	•	A = .-
	•	B = -...
	•	C = -.-.
	•	Z = --..

A dot (.) represents a short signal, and a dash (-) represents a long signal. The timing between signals allows interpretation of characters and words.

Examples
	•	“HELLO” in Morse Code is: .... . .-.. .-.. ---
	•	“WORLD” in Morse Code is: .-- --- .-. .-.. -..
